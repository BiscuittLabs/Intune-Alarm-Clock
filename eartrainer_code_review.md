# üéß Eartrainer Code Review Document

## ‚úÖ Overview

This project provides a music training app that helps users improve their pitch recognition by guessing randomly played notes. It leverages AVFoundation for audio playback and SwiftUI for the interface.

## üìÇ File-by-File Code Review with Actionable Improvements

### 1. `Note.swift`

**Purpose**: Represents a musical note.

**Strengths**:

- Well-documented with computed properties like `description` and `isValid`.
- Implements `Codable`, `Identifiable`.

**Suggestions**:

- [ ] init() defaults to A4. Consider making this explicit in documentation (Default: A4).&#x20;
- [ ] Validate MIDI id within bounds (0‚Äì127) in custom init.

---

### 2. `NoteGenerator.swift`

**Purpose**: Generates notes based on octave range and whether half-steps are included.

**Strengths**:

- [ ] Clear separation of note generation logic.
- [ ] Appropriately uses helper methods for frequency and MIDI mapping.

**Suggestions**:

- Consider caching getNoteNames(true) to avoid recomputation when filtering sharps.
- makeNote() could fail silently if name is invalid. Maybe assert/log when index is not found.

---

### 3. `NoteEngine.swift`

**Purpose**: Manages audio synthesis using sine waves or a SoundFont sampler.

**Strengths**:

- Flexible playback modes.
- Good use of `AVAudioSourceNode` and `AVAudioUnitSampler`.

**Suggestions**:

- [ ] Add validation for soundFontName in setupSamplerEngine before using it.
- [ ]Consider exposing a public method to switch notes without reinitializing NoteEngine.

---

### 4. `NotePlayer.swift`

**Purpose**: Utility for playing notes using `NoteEngine`.

**Strengths**:

- Clean, one-shot note playback logic.
- Dispatches stop event cleanly after delay.

**Suggestions**:

- [ ] Allow injection of playback duration or engine reuse for efficiency (e.g., if multiple notes played in a session).

---

### 5. `PlaybackSettings.swift`

**Purpose**: Struct encapsulating playback configuration.

**Strengths**:

- Clear encapsulation of playback properties.

**Suggestions**:

- [ ] Could conform to Equatable or Codable if settings need to be persisted.

---

### 6. `NoteSettingsViewModel.swift`

**Purpose**: Manages user-configurable settings.

**Strengths**:

- Uses `@Published` to tie into SwiftUI.
- Effectively keeps notes list updated on setting changes.

**Suggestions**:

- [ ] typealias PlaybackMode = NoteEngine.PlaybackMode improves readability‚Äîgreat use!
- [ ] You might consider abstracting NoteGenerator usage so it's injectable for testing/mocking.

---

### 7. `NoteGameViewModel.swift`

**Purpose**: Handles note selection and guessing logic.

**Strengths**:

- Clear separation of game from settings and playback.
- Clean `checkUserGuess` and `playNoteGuess` methods.

**Suggestions**:

- [ ] Add fallback when notes.randomElement() fails (e.g., log error or assert).
- [ ] Test coverage should include guess validation and edge cases.

---

### 8. `SettingsView.swift`

**Purpose**: View for adjusting playback and note generation settings.

**Strengths**:

- Uses segmented controls and stepper effectively.
- Filters SoundFont picker visibility by playback mode.

**Suggestions**:

- [ ] SoundFont picker inside a List might be unconventional in a Form. Consider using Form sections for consistency.
- [ ] Disable playback mode switch if SoundFont list is empty?

---

### 9. `TestingView.swift`

**Purpose**: Main gameplay view.

**Strengths**:

- Responsive UI elements for user feedback.
- Replays and random playback clearly separated.

**Suggestions**:

- [ ] Could modularize note button sections into smaller subviews.
- [ ] Use LazyVGrid instead of HStack for more responsive layout if note count increases.

---

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

- [ ] Add unit tests for NoteGenerator (validate MIDI boundaries, frequency accuracy).
- [ ] Test NoteGameViewModel guessing logic with mocked notes.
- [ ] UI tests for button presses in TestingView.

---

## ‚ú® General Recommendations

### Error Handling

- [ ] Add better fallback behavior in case sound fonts are missing or corrupted.
- [ ] Check for nil sound font files earlier in the pipeline.

### Dependency Injection

- [ ] Allow injecting NoteGenerator and NotePlayer for testing flexibility.

### Performance

- [ ] Consider persisting generated notes unless settings change, to avoid unnecessary regeneration.

### Design

- [ ] The ViewModels follow MVVM well. Ensure views don‚Äôt assume engine internals (you're already doing great here!).

---

## üèÉ Next Steps

- Prioritize critical user-facing stability fixes (e.g., missing SoundFont fallback).
- Address modularity and testability (dependency injection, unit tests).
- Improve layout responsiveness in SwiftUI.

---

## üìä Conclusion

The codebase is modular, readable, and well-suited for SwiftUI. Implementing these suggestions will improve maintainability, testability, and performance.

init() defaults to A4. Consider making this explicit in documentation (Default: A4). Validate MIDI id within bounds (0‚Äì127) in custom init.
